Bedinino
========

Bedinino is an electronic control unit open source project for Bedini monopole motor/generator systems.

It is intended for improve system COP (Coefficient Of Performance), and help other people as a platform for start researching this Free Energy devices.

This is the list of desired requeriments that will be implemented:

- Automatic primary and secondary batteries swap based on 4 bistable relay.
 	* Swap event by:
 	 	> Fixed time, 5 minutes by default (DONE).
 		> Primary and Secondary voltage level, Primary 11.50V and Secondary 13.00V by default (DONE).
- Primary battery voltage adquisition. (DONE)
- Secondary battery voltaga adquisition. (DONE)
- Primary current adquisition by hall effect current sensors (DONE) and Resistors (DO TO).
- Instant√°neos sweet point indicator in magnets per minute / input mA form Primary. (TO DO).
- Secondary current input adquisition and RMS calculations (by software or dedicated AD736 chip). (TO DO)
- Input mAh totalizer. (TO DO)
- Output mAh totalizer. (TO DO)
- Ratiometric magnetic sensor adquisition.(TO DO)
- Tachometer function. (TO DO)
- N-Channel Mosfet drive like Adams motor. (TO DO)
- Pulse delay control by potentiometer.(TO DO)
- Pulse width control by potentiometer. (TO DO)
- Instantaneous COP calculation. (TO DO)
- Automatic Sweet point search algorithm. (TO DO)
- Serialized data output to PC for logging and data plotting in Matlab or LowView.(TO DO)

This project is open to anyone experienced with Bedini monopole devices and Arduino platform to help us develop all these requeriments.

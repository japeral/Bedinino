Bedinino
========

Bedinino is an electronic control unit for Bedini monopole motor/generator systems.

It is intended for improve system COP (Coefficient Of Performance), and help other people as a platform for start researching this Free Energy devices.

This is the list of desired requeriments that will be implemented:

- Primary battery voltage adquisition.
- Secondary battery voltaga adquisition v√≠a isolated channel.
- Primary current adquisition by shunt or hall effect current sensors.
- Secondary current input adquisition and RMS calculations (by software or dedicated hardware).
- Automatic primary and secondary battery swap using latching relays.
- Primary output mAh totalizer.
- Secondary input mAh totalizer.
- Ratiometric magnetic sensor adquisition.
- Tachometer function.
- Magnetometer function.
- N-Channel Mosfet drive.
- Pulse delay control by potentiometer.
- Pulse width control by potentiometer.
- Instantaneous COP calculation.
- Automatic Sweet point search algorithm.
- Serialized data output to PC for logging and data plotting in Matlab or LowView.

This project is open to anyone experienced with Bedini monopole devices and Arduino platform to help us develop all these requeriments.

Thank you and best regards.
